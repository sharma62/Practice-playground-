 ## About OOPs full Explaination with example 
`Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm based on the concept of objects. Objects encapsulate data and behavior and serve as reusable and modular units of code. In JavaScript, OOP is implemented using prototypical inheritance and class syntax. This guide will cover the fundamentals of OOP in JavaScript, including types, classes, objects, and examples.`


> Inheritance
Inheritance allows one object or class to acquire the properties and methods of another. In JavaScript, this can be achieved through prototypical inheritance or class-based inheritance.

Why Use Inheritance?
1. Reuse existing code to avoid duplication.
2. Create specialized child objects or classes that extend the behavior of parent ones.
