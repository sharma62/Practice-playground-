# CRUD Operations with MongoDB Compass using Mongoose

## 📄 Project Description:
This project demonstrates basic **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** (CRUD) operations on a "Product" collection using **Mongoose** and **MongoDB Compass**.

All operations are written inside a single file named `crud.js` and run statically (predefined data). The operations are visible and verifiable via **MongoDB Compass**  . where we use validation or custom validation.
